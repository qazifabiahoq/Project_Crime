## 1. What is the crime distribution by area?
Visualization 1: Bar plot showing the total crime counts for each area.  
Visualization 2: Scatter plot with a linear regression line to explore the correlation between the area and total crime count.
## 2. What are the monthly crime trends over the years?
Visualization 3: Line plot or stacked area chart showing the trend of crime counts for each area over the years.  
Visualization 4: Line plot showing the total monthly crime counts over the entire period.  
Visualization 5: Scatter plot with a linear regression line to explore the correlation between the month and total crime count.  
Visualization 6: Line plot or bar plot showing the average monthly crime counts for each year.  
Visualization 7: Multiple line plots or stacked area charts for different crime types.
## 3. What is the distribution of crime types?
Visualization 8: Pie chart or bar plot showing the distribution of crime types.  
Visualization 9: Scatter plot with a linear regression line to explore the correlation between the crime type and its occurrence.  
Visualization 10: Stacked area chart or grouped bar plot showing changes in the distribution of crime types.  
## 4. What are the demographics of crime victims?
