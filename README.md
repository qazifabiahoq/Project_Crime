# Questions & Analysis
## 1. What is the crime distribution by area?
Visualization 1: Bar plot showing total crime counts for each area.  
Statistical Test: Perform a t-test to compare crime counts between different areas. Identify if there are significant differences.
## 2. What are the monthly crime trends over the years?
Visualization 2: Line plot or stacked area chart showing crime trends for each area.  
Visualization 3: Line plot showing total monthly crime counts.  
Visualization 4: Scatter plot with a linear regression line for the correlation between the month and total crime count.  
Statistical Test: Correlation test to quantify the relationship observed in Visualization 5
## 3. What is the distribution of crime types?
Visualization 5: Pie chart or bar plot showing the distribution of crime types.  
Statistical Test: Chi-square test to analyze the association between crime types and other categorical variables.  
## 4. What are the demographics of crime victims?
Visualization 6: Count plot or pie chart showing the distribution of crime victims by gender.  
Visualization 7: Scatter plot with a linear regression line to explore the correlation between the age of the victim and the count of a specific crime type.  
Visualization 8: Histogram or kernel density plot showing the distribution of victim ages.  
Statistical Test: T-tests or other appropriate tests for comparisons between different demographic groups.
